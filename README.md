## ü§ñ OceanDAO Bot
This bot pipes data from a few different sources, so we can efficiently report DAO-Related informaiton.
- Make sure you have `node` and `npm`
- `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file with the following envs:
```
#The ID and Key used for connecting to Airtable. BASEID points to a specific table.
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=KEY_HERE
AIRTABLE_BASEID=ID_HERE

#BASEID of the GSHEET
GSHEET_BASEID=ID_HERE

#Used to instantiate a web3 provider
INFURA_API_KEY=KEY_HERE

#Used to connect the account to web3
ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=KEY_HERE

#Used for the testing and they are necessary in order have all the tests passed.
#The minimum number of OCEAN tokens needed is 500
WALLET_ADDRESS_WITH_ENOUGH_OCEANS=ADDRESS_HERE
WALLET_ADDRESS_WITH_NOT_ENOUGH_OCEANS=ADDRESS_HERE

#Used for connecting to Snapshot. If not proviede the test Snapshot would be used by defoult.
#Snapshot-hub is a REST API for snapshot fronted

## ‚ùì How To: Access OceanDAO Airtable Data
Anyone can access the live data for OceanDAO.
Design: Consider this a document-based DB.

You can view the [Proposals Airtable through this link](https://airtable.com/shrd5s7HSXc2vC1iC).
This contains all proposals for each funding round, and all required params to execute voting + funding.

You can view the [Funding Rounds Airtable through this link](https://airtable.com/shrvk1ENKwlG8vOBL)
This contains all funding round params required to execute voting + funding OPS (Funding Started -> Voting Ended -> Declare Winners & Amounts.

You can use our [Airtable API Endpoint via this link](https://airtable.com/appVer8ccYGnqSm2H/api/docs#javascript/introduction) and access it via `curl`.

This bot sits on a cron, and updates Airtable to display a voting Leaderboard.
Run the sync_airtable.js script using `node` inside the CLI.

`user@vm:in/your/cli/DAOBot/$ node src/airtable/sync_airtable_active_proposal_votes.js >> log_sync_airtable_active_proposal_votes.csv`


## üìä Airtable - Configure DAOBot to use your Airtable 
Configure your AIRTABLE_API_KEY + AIRTABLE_BASEID to execute the airtable/db sync.
`user@vm:in/your/cli/DAOBot/$node src/airtable/sync_airtable_active_proposal_votes.js`


## üìÑ GSheets - Point DAOBot to GSheet, get Vote Results
You can use DAOBot to dump votes from Snapshot, onto GSheets.
You can [instantly setup your GSheet, to render inside Notion.](https://www.notion.vip/charts/)

This bot also connects with GSheets.
1. Copy your credentials.json into DAOBot/ root  
`user@vm:in/your/cli/DAOBot/$node src/gsheets/index.js`
2. Follow cli prompts. token.json should be generated  
`user@vm:in/your/cli/DAOBot/$node src/gsheets/sync_gsheets_active_proposal_votes.js >> log_sync_gsheets_active_proposal_votes.csv`


## üìÑ Snapshot - Vote for proposals and get vote results
Snapshot is used inside **Ocean DAO** to allow people to vote for the proposals in the voting period of each round.
Only the proposals with the **Proposal State** "Accepted" will be selected for voting inside Snapshot
New Snapshot proposal ballots are created for each round by the DAOBot before the **Voting Period** using the following functions depending on Ballot Type: ```buildBatchProposalPayload()```, ```buildGranularProposalPayload()```
In order for the DAOBot to create the right proposal ballots for Snapshot, for each round there should be specified the right parameters inside the **Funding Round** table from **Airtable** at the current round line
The parameters used for creating the Snapshot proposal ballots are:
1. Vote Type
   - single-choice: each voter may select a single choice to give his total voting power to.
   - weighted: each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices.
2. Ballot Type
   - Batch: a single snapshot instance with all the proposals
   - Granular: one snapshot instance for each proposal 

You can also specify where should DAOBot create the snapshot proposal ballots by setting the env variables.
1. Test
   - SNAPSHOT_SPACE: spring-dao => https://snapshot.org/#/spring-dao
   - SNAPSHOT_URL: snapshot.org
2. Production
   - SNAPSHOT_SPACE: officialoceandao.eth => https://snapshot.org/#/officialoceandao.eth
   - SNAPSHOT_URL: snapshot.org

For getting the voting information from Snapshot, Snapshot-hub it's use which is a REST API for the Snapshot frontend. It can be specified by setting the ```SNAPSHOT_HUB_URL``` env variable.


## ‚è≤Ô∏è CRON - Configure DAOBOT Crontab
The bash scripts located in the root `/DAOBot/` directory should allow you to run the node sync-scripts, from cron.

Instructions  
- From the command line enter: crontab -e
- Execute your cron scripts relative to your `/DAOBot/` path. 
- Your local node installation may be in a different path than what's inside the .sh scripts. Use `which node`.

Example Crontab - Sync every 2 minutes 
```
* * * * * sh /DAOBot/cron_update_funding_round.sh 2>&1
*/5 * * * * sh /DAOBot/cron_project_summary.sh 2>&1
```


## ‚è≤Ô∏è RUN/CRON - DAOBot Main entry points
These are the scripts that you should run to execute DAOBt.
More Coming... Read each script for more details.
- src/airtable/sync_airtable_active_proposal_votes.js
- src/gsheets/sync_gsheets_active_proposal_votes.js
- src/snapshot/submit_snapshot_accepted_proposals.js


## ‚úÖ Testing - How to test DAOBot
```text
DAOBot uses `Jest` library for running the test files.
To run all the test use the following command: 
`npm run test`.
To run a single file the following command is needed:
`jest pathToFile/filename`.
The `env` variable used for testing are different from ones specified in the project and they are set inside github actions Secrets file.
```
