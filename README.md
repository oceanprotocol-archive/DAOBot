## ü§ñ OceanDAO Bot

This bot pipes data from a few different sources, so we can efficiently report DAO-Related informaiton.
- Make sure you have `node` and `npm`
- `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file with the following envs:
```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=KEY_HERE
AIRTABLE_BASEID=ID_HERE
INFURA_API_KEY=KEY_HERE
ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=KEY_HERE
SNAPSHOT_HUB_URL=https://hub.snapshot.page
```
## ‚ùì How To: Access OceanDAO Airtable Data
Anyone can access the live data for OceanDAO.
Design: Consider this a document-based DB.

You can view the [Proposals Airtable through this link](https://airtable.com/shrd5s7HSXc2vC1iC).
This contains all proposals for each funding round, and all required params to execute voting + funding.

You can view the [Funding Rounds Airtable through this link](https://airtable.com/shrvk1ENKwlG8vOBL)
This contains all funding round params required to execute voting + funding OPS (Funding Started -> Voting Ended -> Declare Winners & Amounts.

You can use our [Airtable API Endpoint via this link](https://airtable.com/appVer8ccYGnqSm2H/api/docs#javascript/introduction) and access it via `curl`.

This bot sits on a cron, and updates Airtable to display a voting Leaderboard.
Run the sync_airtable.js script using `node` inside the CLI.

`user@vm:in/your/cli/DAOBot/$ node src/airtable/sync_airtable_active_proposal_votes.js >> log_sync_airtable_active_proposal_votes.csv`
